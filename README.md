This example demonstrates a common error in Ruby classes where a `getter` method is defined for an instance variable, but no corresponding `setter` method exists. This results in a `NoMethodError` when an attempt is made to modify the instance variable directly through the getter method. The solution showcases the appropriate way to create a setter method using the `attr_writer` or `attr_accessor` method to avoid this error.
